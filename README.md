## HealthTrends – Distributed Health Data Analyzer
## Project Overview
HealthTrends is an end-to-end distributed data engineering project that processes healthcare patient records using Kafka, HDFS, PySpark, and Python orchestration to generate daily health trend reports.

## Architecture
## Pipeline Flow:
Kafka Producer → Kafka Broker → Python Consumer → HDFS → PySpark → CSV Reports
Kafka streams patient health events

Python consumer validates records

HDFS stores data in date-partitioned format

PySpark aggregates healthcare trends

## Technologies Used
Apache Kafka (Producer & Consumer)

Python

HDFS (Cloudera QuickStart VM)

Apache Spark (PySpark)

## Workflow Summary
## 1. Kafka Ingestion
Patient health data is produced to Kafka topics.
## 2. Validation & Storage
Python consumer validates schema and stores clean records in HDFS:
/healthTrend/patient_json/date=YYYY-MM-DD/
## 3. Spark Processing
PySpark reads data from HDFS and computes:

Diagnosis-wise patient count

Average patient age

Gender ratio
## 4. Report Output
Final reports are written back to HDFS as CSV:
/healthTrend/reports/trend_summary/date=YYYY-MM-DD/
## 5. Orchestration
A Python orchestration script automates:

Data ingestion

HDFS operations

Spark job execution

Error handling and retries.
